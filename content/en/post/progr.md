<div text-align: center>Science in programming â€” the past or reality? How much of it is in languages and why are there holivars about the advantages of some languages over others? If you are interested, I ask under the cat.</div>

<div text-align: center>For a long time there have been "holy wars" in which various approaches in writing programs and in programming itself are discussed and criticized, mainly Object-Oriented Programming is criticized (one, two, three).</div>

<div text-align: center>Egor Bugayenko criticizes the PLO on practical examples (one, two, video), using the ideas of David West and, as I understood, recently went towards theory. The effectiveness of these disputes tends to zero. Why? Because all these disputes are already being conducted on the basis of the realizations of some thoughts, practices and opinions of individuals, and not on the basis of theoretical works. The scientific method and approach with its theories, hypotheses, axioms, experiments, proofs and facts in recent years in these disputes and "wars" there is no word at all!</div>
