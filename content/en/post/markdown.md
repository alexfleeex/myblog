Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed for writing, reading, and formatting web texts.

The language is partially or completely supported by many projects:

- CMS and blog platforms (Drupal, Ghost, Medium);
- the largest content repositories (GitHub, Microsoft Docs);
- messenger (Telegram, Sam);
- text editors (Atom, iA Writer, Typora);
- project management services (Todoist, Trello).

The Markdown syntax is much simpler than HTML, but .md documents convert to .html without any problems.
