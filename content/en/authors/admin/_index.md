I was born on 7.11.2003 and lived all my 18 years in Moscow.

<div style="text-align: justify">In 2021, I passed the Unified State Exam in mathematics (78), computer science (93), physics (95), Russian (92). Thanks to my scores, I was able to enroll on a budget at the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia at the Faculty of Physics, Mathematics and Natural Sciences. In choosing the field of education, my eye fell on the direction of "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science". Now I am finishing my first course of study in this direction. </div>
